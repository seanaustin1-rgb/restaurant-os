# Restaurant OS — Session Handoff

> Safe to email — contains **no secrets**. Bring your `.env.local` separately.

## Resume a session
Open the repo and tell Claude:
> "Read the README, `docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`, and `docs/specs/allocation-variance-engine.md`, and check your project memory for Restaurant OS. Start from the **⏱️ RESUME HERE — 2026-06-13** block below (it's authoritative). PR #18 (Debt Service → Profit) is MERGED and the Toast `orders:read` scope is now GRANTED — operational Toast access is live. The next build is the live sales-tax skim (now unblocked); the remaining operator action is adding the 6 Toast env vars to Vercel."

> **⚠️ Two sessions have worked this repo (2026-06-12/13).** The 2026-06-13 RESUME HERE block reflects the
> latest state and is authoritative. The 10 live tiles + Toast era integration (this doc's "Where we are")
> and the Allocation engine + Vercel deploy (the RESUME block) are BOTH on `main`. **PR #18 is MERGED** and
> **Toast operational scopes are now GRANTED** (orders/cashmgmt/labor) — the era + operational APIs run on
> TWO separate credential sets (see below).

## ⏱️ RESUME HERE — 2026-06-13 (LIVE ON VERCEL)

**The app is deployed and working in production:** **https://restaurant-os-hazel.vercel.app**
(Vercel project `restaurant-os`, Hobby plan, auto-deploys on every push to `main`.)
To just USE/demo it: open that URL in any browser, **Sign in** (not Sign up) as the
OPERATOR who owns Stone Grille — `clerkUserId user_3EYUw6yNiDgTiBoorH0c9GuLPR2`; its
email is in the Clerk dashboard → Users (a `+clerk_test@…` address); OTP `424242`.

**Shipped to `main` since the engine work:** Allocation & Variance engine (core +
live `/modules/allocation` view, PR #17), TAP editor `/settings/allocation` + 3-way
COGS drill-down (PR #16), software-vendors→Technology categorization fix (`c664d5a`),
`DEPLOY.md` (Vercel + Bluehost-domain steps), **PR #18 Debt Service → Profit (`8212ce3`)**.
All build clean.

**Backlog cleared 2026-06-13 (all on `main` except the wizard):**
- **Tax Vault + Sales-Tax skim** (`/modules/tax-vault`) — collected sales tax from the Toast
  Orders API (per-check taxAmount), reserve OK/SHORT; allocation view Tax Reserve uses it.
- **Allocation production phase** — persisted bucket ledger (`BucketAllocation` + recomputed
  `VirtualAccount` balances + `BucketSweep` 10th/25th sweeps), daily Inngest run; allocation view
  shows balances + sweeps. `src/lib/profit-first/ledger.ts`. Obligation/reconciliation sub-tables
  deferred (no integration feeds).
- **Health-status vocabulary unified** (defined once; usage thresholds named).
- **Category Trends & Budgets** (`/modules/category-trends`) — MoM 6-month bars + per-category
  monthly budgets (`Category.monthlyBudget`) + budget-vs-actual.
- **Setup wizard** (`/onboarding/vendors`) — top vendors by spend → confirm category → seeds
  per-tenant KEYWORD rule + recategorizes. **LOCAL commit `ec2efea`, push pending operator OK.**
- Migrations applied this session: `add_daily_sales_tax`, `allocation_ledger`, `category_budget`
  (**15 total now**). **Operator-run backfills still pending**: `scripts/sync-toast-sales-tax.ts 21`
  + `scripts/run-allocation-ledger.ts` (prod-DB writes — run in your own terminal).

**✅ TOAST OPERATIONAL ACCESS GRANTED 2026-06-13 — dual-credential connector shipped (`04a1be8`).**
The operator created a **Standard API** credential set in the Toast portal (the existing "Deep dive"
set is Analytics-only / `reporting-api-onboarding`; Analytics vs Standard scopes live on SEPARATE API
clients — one client can't hold both). Scope probe now **200 on all 8 operational endpoints**
(orders, cashmgmt, labor.employees/jobs/timeEntries, config menus/diningOptions, restaurants).
- **Connector now reads TWO credential sets** (`src/lib/integrations/toast/{config,auth,analytics}.ts`):
  base `TOAST_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` = **Standard/operational**; new optional
  `TOAST_ANALYTICS_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` = **Analytics (era)**. `config.getToastAnalyticsCredentials()`
  falls back to the base creds when the analytics vars are unset (single-set deployments unaffected);
  `auth.ts` caches tokens per-clientId so both sets coexist; `analytics.ts` era auth uses the analytics
  set. Verified live: operational 200s + era metrics returning real Stone Grille data. tsc + build clean.
- **`.env.local` now has all 6 Toast vars** (4 base + 2 analytics). `.env.example` documents the 2 new ones.

**OPERATOR ACTIONS NOW (next):**
1. **Add the 6 Toast vars to Vercel** (Project → Settings → Environment Variables, **Production +
   Preview**) so the live daily Inngest sync + any live Toast reads work in prod:
   `TOAST_CLIENT_ID`, `TOAST_CLIENT_SECRET`, `TOAST_ANALYTICS_CLIENT_ID`, `TOAST_ANALYTICS_CLIENT_SECRET`,
   `TOAST_API_HOSTNAME`, `TOAST_RESTAURANT_GUID` (same values as `.env.local`). Vercel-dashboard action.
2. **Build the live Sales-Tax skim** (now UNBLOCKED) — read Toast's collected sales tax via the
   Orders/cashmgmt API (`orders:read`/`cashmgmt:read` now granted) for the pre-allocation skim + Tax Vault
   tile (spec §C3.3 / allocation engine). This was THE thing gated on the scope grant.

**✅ DONE 2026-06-13 (the former gate 2 — all landed):**
   - **PR #18 Debt Service → Profit — MERGED** (`8212ce3`, squash, branch deleted).
     Migration `20260613120000_add_profit_tap_bucket` **applied to live Supabase**
     (12 migrations now); `scripts/fix-debt-service-bucket.ts` flipped the existing
     "Debt Service" Category `tapBucket` OPEX→PROFIT on all 3 restaurants (committed to
     `main`, `8f591a0`). Debt Service now draws against the Profit gauge.
   - **Tech fix — applied:** `fix-tech-categorization.ts --commit` moved 4 Stone Grille
     txns ($1,671.60) + Sandbox/Demo rules Smallwares→Technology. OPEX total unchanged
     ($61,170.12) — drill-down only.
   - **Classifier note for next session:** prod-DB script writes (`tsx scripts/*.ts --commit`)
     are HARD-blocked from inside Claude Code and a broad `Bash(npx dotenv:*)` allow rule
     is itself rejected (arbitrary `--` passthrough). The reliable path is the **operator
     runs the script in their own PowerShell** (see the npx execution-policy gotcha in
     "Loose ends"). Migrations via `prisma migrate deploy` and merges-to-main DO go through
     after an explicit in-conversation "go".

**Backlog — CLEARED 2026-06-13** (persisted bucket-ledger + sweeps, setup wizard, health-status
unify, category trends/budgets, Tax Vault — all built; see "Backlog cleared" list above). Remaining
deferred: the obligation/reconciliation sub-tables + MarginEdge/Davo pull-clear event handlers (need
integration feeds that don't exist yet); **scheduled-vs-actual labor** (Toast `/labor/v1/shifts` works
but the schedule is sparse until Sling fully publishes into Toast — operator-side fix). Operator gates
still open: 6 Toast vars → Vercel, the two backfills, close PR #1.

### To continue dev work on another machine / Claude Code web
1. Clone the repo (everything's on GitHub, incl. the in-flight branch).
2. **Bring `.env.local` securely** — it's the ONLY thing not in the repo (DB password
   + all keys). Without it, local scripts/builds won't run, but editing + pushing
   (which auto-deploys via Vercel) works fine.
3. `npm install` → `npx prisma generate` → `npm run dev`. DB is shared (Supabase), no
   migration needed to develop (all 12 migrations applied, incl. the debt-service one).
4. Project memory lives in the local `~/.claude` config and may NOT travel to a new
   machine — **this doc is the source of truth.**

## What this is
Multi-tenant restaurant-operator SaaS with a **Profit First** cash layer. Next.js 14 · Supabase/Prisma · Clerk · Plaid · Inngest · Vercel. Customer Zero = Stone Grille & Taphouse.

## Where we are (done & working)
- **✅ 10 DASHBOARD TILES LIVE + the Allocation engine + deployed to Vercel (as of 2026-06-13).** Live tiles:
  Cash Flow · Vendor Spend · Spending by Category · **Recurring & Subscriptions** · **Cash Runway** ·
  **Payment Watch** (bank-data) + **Covers Flow** · **Labor Hours** · **Sales Mix** · **Menu Engineering**
  (Toast `era` analytics). Allocation & Variance engine at `/modules/allocation` (+ `/settings/allocation`).
  Daily 5:30am ET Inngest sync refreshes Toast metrics/mix/menu-items. Details for each are below.
- **Tier-3 AI bank-statement import is LIVE**: scanned PDF → Claude structured extraction → categorized transactions → Profit First dashboard. Real May data imported to restaurant **"Stone Grille and Tap House"** (`cmpvtkou90000syl9ziir8nlj`), 282 txns; 28 days of seeded sales so the gauges compute.
- **Categorization v2 — Phase 1 mostly built & shipped:**
  - **Two-level model live**: `Category` (per-restaurant, operator-extensible) → fixed `TapBucket` enum. `Transaction.categoryId` added; legacy `bucket` kept (dual-write).
  - 26 default categories seeded per restaurant; all 282 txns backfilled (manual edits preserved); new imports dual-write `categoryId`.
  - **Dashboard rollup** now computes TAP gauges from categories.
  - **Categories settings screen** at `/settings/categories` — add / rename / remap-TAP / archive (CRUD, auth-guarded, archive blocked while a category has txns).
- **Per-restaurant rules engine — shipped** (`Rule` table; new imports self-categorize per tenant). Phase 3 added **suggested rules** from repeated manual categorizations.
- **Global app header** — nav appears on every page.
- **Dashboard Modules framework (`src/lib/modules.ts`)** — the honest registry that replaced the mock tile list. `"live"` tiles link to a real page; `"soon"` tiles render disabled with the `blockedBy` dependency that unblocks them, so **nothing on the dashboard is a fake/dead control**. The grid renders from this list.
- **Original three bank-data modules** (the established pattern every later tile follows: loader in `src/lib/modules/*.ts`, server page at `/modules/*`, client component in `src/components/modules/*`):
  - **Cash Flow** (`/modules/cash-flow`) — daily in/out, net-by-day bar chart, running balance. Sign convention: inflows stored **negative**, outflows **positive**.
  - **Vendor Spend** (`/modules/vendor-spend`) — spend by supplier, largest first, share bars; groups vendors by the same signature logic as the rules engine.
  - **Spending by Category** (`/modules/spending`) — outflows grouped into COGS / Labor / OpEx / Owner's Pay / Taxes / Other as a **profit donut** (spend groups + a profit slice = money in), plus a detailed per-category table. **Cash basis**, consistent with Cash Flow.
- **On GitHub** (private), README + specs + this handoff committed.

## Run it locally
```
git clone https://github.com/seanaustin1-rgb/restaurant-os.git
cd restaurant-os && npm install
# put your .env.local in place (NOT in the repo — bring it securely)
npx prisma generate
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```
DB is already migrated on Supabase (shared) — no migration needed to develop.

## NEXT STEP — see the ⏱️ RESUME HERE block at the top (authoritative)

The two big tracks below are now **SHIPPED** (kept as a record; the RESUME-HERE block has the real
current gates):

**1. ✅ Allocation & Variance Engine — SHIPPED (PRs #16, #17).** Core + live `/modules/allocation` view +
`/settings/allocation` TAP editor + 3-way COGS drill-down. Spec: `docs/specs/allocation-variance-engine.md`.
The persisted bucket-ledger + Inngest sweeps ("production phase") remain deferred (see RESUME block backlog),
and PR #18 (Debt Service → Profit bucket) is **in flight**.

**2. ◑ Toast integration — analytics wave SHIPPED, operational wave BLOCKED.** Four `era`-analytics tiles
(Covers Flow, Labor Hours actual, Sales Mix, Menu Engineering) + daily sync are live (PRs #6–#10, detail
below). The remaining tiles (Tax Vault live skim, Food Cost, real-time orders) need the operator to grant
**operational scopes** (`orders:read`, `cashmgmt:read`, `labor.*:read`) on the Toast API client — re-probed
2026-06-13, still 403 (analytics-only creds). Scheduled-vs-actual labor still needs **Sling**.

> **✅ DONE (2026-06-12): Toast connector scaffolding built AND verified live.**
> Standalone `src/lib/integrations/toast/` module — OAuth2 client-credentials auth + process-local
> token cache (`auth.ts`), typed `toastFetch` that injects the `Toast-Restaurant-External-ID` header
> and retries once on 401 (`client.ts`), config guard `isToastConfigured()` (`config.ts`), barrel
> `index.ts`. Env contract added to `.env.example`: `TOAST_CLIENT_ID`, `TOAST_CLIENT_SECRET`,

> (`.env.local`, NOT a web session): ✓ config present → ✓ **OAuth2 login succeeds** (real bearer token)
> → restaurant-scoped read returns **403** = GUID + header **accepted**, but this API client's granted
> **scopes** don't yet cover `/restaurants`. So the connector plumbing is proven end-to-end; reading
> actual data just needs the relevant scope enabled on the Toast API client.
>
> **Credential facts learned (2026-06-12):** these are **Standard (restaurant-scoped) API credentials**,
> NOT a partner integration — the Partners API (`/partners/v1/restaurants`) returns
> `401 "partnerGuid must be supplied in token"`, so there's no partner restaurant-list to query; the
> restaurant GUID must be supplied directly (it's a UUID issued with the client id/secret).
> `TOAST_RESTAURANT_GUID` is a UUID (8-4-4-4-12), **not** the access-type label `TOAST_MACHINE_CLIENT`.
>
> **⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING (2026-06-12): the current creds are ANALYTICS-only, not operational.**
> Decoded the access-token claims: `iss=toast-pos.toasttab.auth0.com`, **`scope=enterprise-metrics:read`**
> — the only granted scope. So this client is provisioned for the Toast **Analytics / Enterprise Metrics
> API**, NOT Standard (operational) API Access. A scope probe of 8 operational endpoints (labor.employees,
> labor.jobs, labor.timeEntries, orders, menus, config/diningOptions, restaurants, cashmgmt) returned
> **403 on all 8** (`scripts/toast-scope-probe.ts`). The six-tile plan — especially Labor Hours
> (scheduled-vs-actual *hours*, punch/shift level) — needs **operational** scopes (`labor:read`,
> `labor.employees:read`, `orders:read`, `config:read`, `menus:read`, `cashmgmt:read`). **Decision pending
> (operator):** (A) request **Standard API Access** from Toast with those operational read scopes, and/or
> (B) build on the **enterprise-metrics** Analytics (`era`) API we already have. **Operator chose BOTH
> (2026-06-12): B now, A in parallel.**
>
> **✅ ANALYTICS API VERIFIED WORKING (2026-06-12).** `scripts/toast-analytics-probe.ts` ran the full
> async flow against `https://ws-api.toasttab.com` and pulled REAL data for Customer Zero:
> `POST /era/v1/metrics/day {startBusinessDate,endBusinessDate (same day, YYYYMMDD int), restaurantIds:[GUID],
> excludedRestaurantIds:[], groupBy:[]}` → `reportRequestGuid` → `GET /era/v1/metrics/{guid}` (note: the
> consolidated path; `/era/v1/metrics/{timeRange}/{guid}` is **410 deprecated**). timeRange `day` requires
> start==end. **Per-day fields returned:** `guestCount, ordersCount, openOrdersCount, closedOrdersCount,
> voidOrdersCount, discountOrderCount, netSalesAmount, grossSalesAmount, discountAmount, voidOrdersAmount,
> refundAmount, avgOrderValue, hourlyJobTotalHours, hourlyJobTotalPay, hourlyJobSalesPerLaborHour`.
> `groupBy` ∈ {REVENUE_CENTER, DINING_OPTION, ORDER_SOURCE}; `aggregateBy` DAY|HOUR (day only). Separate
> `POST/GET /era/v1/menu` for menu-item reporting; `/era/v1/guest/payments/{guid}` for guest data.
>
> **Tiles buildable NOW on analytics (no new Toast access):** **Covers Flow** (guestCount/ordersCount),
> **Sales Mix** (netSales + groupBy DINING_OPTION/ORDER_SOURCE/REVENUE_CENTER; menu-item via `/era/v1/menu`),
> **Labor productivity / ACTUAL hours** (hourlyJobTotalHours, hourlyJobTotalPay, salesPerLaborHour — WoW/YoY
> trend). **Still need other sources:** **scheduled** hours for true scheduled-vs-actual (Sling — analytics
> has actual only), item-level **food cost %** (Stock/inventory or MarginEdge — no cost in metrics), and any
> real-time **orders** detail. Connector note: analytics calls use `restaurantIds` in the body, NOT the
> `Toast-Restaurant-External-ID` header — add an `era`/analytics client method alongside `toastFetch`.
>
> **A (in parallel):** request **Standard API Access** from Toast for operational read scopes
> (`labor:read`, `labor.employees:read`, `orders:read`, `menus:read`, `config:read`, `stock:read`,
> `cashmgmt:read`) — reference the existing client id; do NOT paste the secret. Separately evaluate the
> **Sling** API for scheduled hours.
>
> **era client BUILT (2026-06-12):** `src/lib/integrations/toast/analytics.ts` — `runMetricsReport()`,
> `getMetricsForDay()`, `getMetricsForDays()` (per-day loop for trends; cache it), `toBusinessDate()`,
> typed `MetricsRow`. Body-based restaurantIds + async POST→poll-GET handled. Exported from the barrel;

>
> **✅ FOUR TOAST TILES LIVE + DAILY SYNC (2026-06-12; PRs #6, #7, #8, #9, #10 — all on main).**
> Shared pattern: era → `DailySales` upsert off the render path (`toast/sync.ts`), loader reads
> `DailySales` (fast), server page + client component, tile flipped live in `modules.ts`.
> - **Covers Flow** (`/modules/covers-flow`, PR #6) — daily guests/orders/avg check. 21 real days
>   backfilled (avg 222.6 covers/day); **overwrote May seed rows** with real Toast figures.
> - **Daily Inngest sync** (PR #7) — `dailyToastSyncScheduler` (5:30am ET) → `syncToastMetrics` worker,
>   3-day lookback, idempotent; worker also refreshes the sales mix (added in #9). Single-tenant
>   resolver `resolveToastRestaurantId()` (PosConnection TOAST match → Customer-Zero fallback).
> - **Labor Hours (actual)** (`/modules/labor`, PR #8) — migration `20260612190000_add_labor_hours`
>   added nullable `DailySales.laborHours` (**applied to shared DB**). Weekly actual hours, labor $,
>   sales/labor-hour, labor %; **WoW compares the two latest FULL weeks** (partial weeks badged, never
>   read as a drop); YoY gated on real prior-year data (hidden now). Scheduled-vs-actual still parked
>   for Sling.
> - **Sales Mix** (`/modules/sales-mix`, PR #9) — migration `20260612200000_add_sales_mix` added
>   nullable JSONB `DailySales.mixByRevenueCenter` (**applied to shared DB**). Probed groupBy dims:
>   dining-option & order-source are degenerate for this operator; **revenue center is the meaningful
>   mix** (verified May 22–Jun 11, $121.8k: Dining Room 51.7 / Bar 21.1 / Patio 11.8 / Echo Reserve 8.0 /
>   To-Go 5.3 / Online 2.1%). Item/category mix needs `/era/v1/menu` — future work.
> - **Menu Engineering** (`/modules/menu-eng`, PR #10) — migration `20260612210000_add_menu_item_sales`
>   created the `MenuItemSales` table (**applied to shared DB**). `runMenuReport()` in the era client;
>   API constraints verified live: **one groupBy max, only day/week ranges**; rows per businessDate×item.
>   Weekly sync (groupBy MENU_ITEM) → popularity×revenue quadrants on median splits (NOT margin — cost
>   data unavailable; footnote says directional). Backfilled 4 weeks: 4,560 item-day rows, 445 items,
>   $162k net; top star Cheeseburger. Daily worker refreshes the current week.
>
> **Still TODO:** (a) add the four `TOAST_*` vars to **Vercel** (Prod+Preview) + **web env config** if web
> sessions need Toast — all three migrations are in the repo and apply on deploy; (b) **Food Cost** needs
> item/recipe COST data (MarginEdge has no recipe API; → Toast Stock API via Track A, or manual cost
> entry); true margin-based menu engineering unlocks with the same data; (c) Track A: Standard API Access
> request to Toast (operational scopes) + Sling for scheduled hours.

**Other bank-data modules on deck (no Toast needed):**
- ~~**Recurring & Subscriptions**~~ **SHIPPED (2026-06-12, PR #12)** — `/modules/recurring`. Groups outflows
  by `signatureOf` across full history; recurring = ≥3 hits at a steady cadence OR vendor-map `isRecurring`.
  Est/mo = cadence projection for fixed-price ("SUB", CV<0.10) vendors, **actuals pro-rated** for variable
  ones (avoids inflating mixed groups like Toast payroll+fees). Price creep only on subs (≥3 hits, ≥2%).
  Honest short-history banner (<60 days). Verified on Customer Zero: 24 recurring vendors, ~$149k/mo
  (Toast payroll $65k, PFG $35k, PLCB $11.8k…). No migration needed.
- ~~**Cash Runway**~~ **SHIPPED (2026-06-12, PR #13)** — `/modules/cash-runway`. **No balance feed exists**
  (statement import skips balance lines; no Plaid balance stored; Customer Zero has no live Plaid link) →
  operator enters a one-time **balance anchor** (balance + statement date; columns
  `Restaurant.cashBalanceAnchor/.cashBalanceAnchorDate`, migration `20260612220000`, **applied**).
  Runway = anchor + net txns since (inflows stored NEGATIVE → net = −sum), burn = 28-day avg daily net,
  green/yellow/red at >90/30–90/<30 days, area chart with 8-week projection + staleness banner.
  Math verified to the penny with a temp anchor (then cleared — **operator still needs to enter the real
  balance** at `/modules/cash-runway`).
- ~~**Duplicate / unusual payment catcher**~~ **SHIPPED (2026-06-12, PR #14) as "Payment Watch"** —
  `/modules/payment-watch`. Duplicates: "likely" (same signature + exact amount ≤3 days) and "look"
  (same amount ≥$500 ≤10 days — catches double-cashed checks, which have no vendor signature). Unusual:
  ≥3× the vendor's median (≥4 occurrences, ≥$200). No migration. **First run surfaced a real candidate
  (correctly in the "look" tier, not "likely"):** two checks — #10451 (2026-05-18) and #10465 (2026-05-26)
  — both $1,177.69, 8 days apart. NOTE: distinct check numbers, so NOT one check double-cashed; either a
  duplicate invoice paid via two checks or a legit recurring obligation — operator to confirm payee in the
  register. Checks post as bare `CHECK #N` (no payee), which is why the amount-only "look" tier exists.
  Plus 7 off-norm charges (York Water $1,000 vs usual $113, etc.).

### Categorization backlog (older — verify status before picking up)
1. **Beer/Beverage as its own dashboard gauge line** — `cogsBeverage` is computed in `src/lib/dashboard/data.ts`; may still need a gauge in the dashboard components (verify, the beverage settings/gauges work landed since).
2. **Categorization Phase 2 polish** — spend-by-category drill-down, bulk recategorize, rule-management UI. (Rules engine itself is shipped.)

**Operator decisions locked:** Misc → OpEx (until named); COGS_BEVERAGE = its own gauge line; Bank/Register Cash → EXCLUDED (register restocks); cash tip-outs → EXCLUDED, never Labor (pass-through to servers — also why some Toast deposits net low/negative).
**Still open:** rule precedence on multi-match; per-category OpEx sub-budgets; whether the beverage line gets its own target %.

## DB migrations — status (2026-06-13)
**All 12 migrations on `main` are APPLIED to the shared Supabase DB** (`prisma migrate status` =
"Database schema is up to date"), through `20260613120000_add_profit_tap_bucket`. Earlier additions:
`add_labor_hours`, `add_sales_mix`, `add_menu_item_sales`, `add_cash_balance_anchor`. The 12th
(`add_profit_tap_bucket`, PR #18) was applied via `prisma migrate deploy` when PR #18 merged — all
additive/nullable, forward-only, no `migrate dev`, no reset.

**No unapplied migrations.** New machines: `npx prisma generate` is enough to develop; the schema is current.

## ⬇️ FROM AN EARLIER (EXTERNAL) CHAT — TO INTEGRATE
> The operator has a block of notes/decisions/requests from a separate conversation
> to paste in. **Placeholder added 2026-06-12.** When provided, fold each item into
> the relevant section above (modules roadmap, locked decisions, specs) rather than
> leaving it parked here.

<!-- PASTE BLOCK BELOW -->
**Integrated 2026-06-12** → full **Profit First Allocation & Variance Engine** spec saved to
**`docs/specs/allocation-variance-engine.md`** (operator block verbatim + repo-grounding +
open-decisions). It's the real version of NEXT STEP #1. Open decisions that **conflict with
previously-locked state** (resolve before migration):
- **TAP split changes:** Labor 32→**27**, OpEx 28→**20**, new **Spill 13%** bucket. Customer Zero's
  `TapSettings` row needs a data-update (defaults only hit new rows).
- **Beer line:** earlier lock = "COGS_BEVERAGE its own gauge line"; this spec folds beer/wine into
  **COGS Liquor** (Food 18 / Liquor 12 only) for allocation. Confirm override.
- **Ledger:** extend existing `VirtualAccount` rather than add a parallel `BucketBalance`.
- **Tax source of truth:** Tax Reserve (sales) + the Tax Vault tile both use **Davo's actual pull**,
  never a 6% estimate (PA: all alcohol sales-tax exempt; 6% food + non-alc only; York County).
<!-- /PASTE BLOCK -->

## Where secrets go (so they're visible in web sessions AND in prod)
Secrets live in **three separate stores** — setting one does **not** populate the others:
1. **Claude Code web environment config** → so the agent can see them *in a web session right now*.
   Set them as environment variables/secrets on the environment this session launches from
   (docs: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web). They're injected into the container
   as env vars. **Currently EMPTY — this is the gap.** Whatever was added before isn't reaching this env.
2. **Vercel project env vars** → so they work *once live* (Production + Preview scopes).
3. **`.env.local`** → local dev only (never committed).
Toast vars to set in #1 and #2: `TOAST_CLIENT_ID`, `TOAST_CLIENT_SECRET`, `TOAST_API_HOSTNAME`,
`TOAST_RESTAURANT_GUID`. **Rotate** any key that was ever pasted into chat before going live.

**Dead ends that do NOT work (verified 2026-06-12 — don't retry):**
- **Dropping a file in `~/.claude/`.** That folder is Claude Code's *own* internal config (its auth
  token, session transcripts, hooks, skills) — not a secrets store. A file there never becomes a
  `process.env.*` var the app reads, and the folder is rebuilt fresh each container (not carried over
  from a prior session), so anything placed there is gone next session.
- **Assuming a previous session's `.env.local` / uploaded file persists.** Containers are ephemeral and
  cloned fresh from the repo; only committed files survive, and secrets must never be committed.
- **The ONLY mechanism that makes a secret visible to the agent in a web session** is store #1 above
  (env vars/secrets in the web environment's configuration), injected into the container as real env
  vars. This is a platform UI action the operator must do — the agent cannot place or read it for them.

## Loose ends / reminders
- **Bring `.env.local`** — the only thing not in the repo (DB password + all keys).
- **Supabase free-tier pauses after inactivity.** If scripts/app error with `FATAL (ENOTFOUND) tenant/user … not found`, the project is asleep — open the Supabase dashboard (project ref `rweclputxgwutykinlbr`) and **Restore/Resume** it.
- **Rotate secrets before production** — keys passed through chat during setup.
- **Duplicate restaurant**: empty twin "Stone Grille and Taphouse" (`cmpvtq12q000i…`) from onboarding twice — delete with `npx dotenv -e .env.local -- tsx scripts/cleanup-restaurants.ts` (lists all; add `--delete <id> --commit` to remove the empty one — refuses non-empty without `--force`).
- **Before deploy**: apply the pending migration (above); `/api/dev/*` routes are already hardened (middleware 404s them in prod **and** each handler self-guards on `NODE_ENV`, so they can stay); run `next build` with real env present; set Vercel env WITHOUT `INNGEST_DEV`. **Rotate any secrets** shared via chat during setup. Note: `middleware.ts` is correct for the pinned Next 14 — the `proxy` rename only applies if you upgrade to Next 16.
- **Gotchas** (Windows): Node may be off-PATH; run Prisma via `npx dotenv -e .env.local -- prisma ...`; use batched `$transaction([...])` over the Supabase pooler (not interactive); Clerk test emails use code `424242`; new route segments need a dev-server restart to register.
- **PowerShell execution policy** (Windows): `npx`/`npm`/`prisma` resolve to `.ps1` shims that fail with `running scripts is disabled on this system` under the default Restricted/RemoteSigned-machine policy. Two fixes: one-off, call the `.cmd` shim (`npx.cmd dotenv …`); durable, run once `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` (done on Customer-Zero machine 2026-06-13). NOTE: the Claude Code **Bash tool** runs `npx` fine (Git-Bash, no `.ps1` shim) even when the operator's PowerShell can't.
- **Prod-DB script writes must be operator-run** (2026-06-13): `tsx scripts/*.ts --commit` against shared Supabase is HARD-blocked from inside Claude Code's auto-mode, and a broad `Bash(npx dotenv:*)` allow rule is rejected too (it'd authorize arbitrary `--` passthrough). Have the **operator run the script in their own terminal**. `prisma migrate deploy` and merges-to-`main` DO proceed after an explicit in-chat "go".
